# Detecting Hexadirectional Signals in the Human Brain using R and FSL

Grid-like hexadirectional signals are thought of as a proxy-measure for the activity of grid cell populations ([Doeller et al., Nature, 2010](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08704)). The goal of this project is to showcase the analysis pipeline to detect these hexadirectional signals using FSL and R.

The code requires [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki) to be installed and to be accessible from R. See [here](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation) for detailed installation instructions. For more details on how to run the code, see the [GitPages](https://jacbel.github.io/hexadirectional_signals_R_FSL/) associated with this project.
